Find and read the documentation for pthread_cancel(). Then, using your C programming environment, use the information and the model provided in Figure 2.4 on page 26 of the text book to write a program in which the initial (main) thread creates a second thread. The main thread should read input from the keyboard, waiting until the user presses the Enter key. At that point, it should kill off the second thread and print out a message reporting that it has done so. Meanwhile, the second thread should be in an infinite loop, each time around sleeping five seconds and then printing out a message. Try running your program. Can the sleeping thread print its periodic messages while the main thread is waiting for keyboard input? Can the main thread read input, kill the sleeping thread, and print a message while the sleeping thread is in the early part of one of its five-second sleeps?

```
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

static void *child(void *ignored){
   while(1){
      sleep(5);
      printf("Child is done sleeping 5 seconds\n");
   }
   return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
   pthread_t child_thread;
   int code;
   char inp;

   code = pthread_create(&child_thread, NULL, child, NULL);
   if(code){
      fprintf(stderr, "pthread_create failed with code %d\n", code);
   }

   while(1){
      scanf("%c", &inp);
	  if(inp == '\n'){
         pthread_cancel(child_thread);
		 printf("Child thread has been  killed\n");
		 break;
	  }
   }
   return 0;
}
```

# The answer
Yes. The sleeping thread can print its periodic messages while the main thread is waiting for keyboard input. <br>
Yes. The main thread can read input, kill the sleeping thread, and print a message while the sleeping thread is still in the early part of one of its five-second sleeps.
