## 5. Suppose T1 writes new values into x and y and T2 reads the values of both x and y. Is it possible for T2 to see the old value of x but the new value of y? Answer this question three times: once assuming the use of two-phase locking, once assuming the read committed isolation level is used and is implemented with short read locks, and once assuming snapshot isolation. In each case, justify your answer.

a) Two-phase locking 
No. It is impossible for T2 to see the old value of x but the new value of y. T2 can see the most recent value of both x and y with two-phase locking. Because each read can see the most recently written value after T1 is writing.
<br>
b) Read committed isolation
Yes. It is possible for T2 to see the old value of x but the new value of y. T2 can have a chance to read the old value of x and the new value of y because the read committed isolation results in exclusively locking the write transactions but the read transactions use a shared lock.
<br>
c) Snapshot isolation
Yes. It is possible for T2 to see the old value of x but the new value of y. A read action can read older values because each write action stores the new value for a variable in a different location.

## 7. At the lower right of Figure 6.13 on page 236 are page numbers 1047552 and 1047553. Explain how these page numbers were calculated.

Each page table has 1024 page frames and there are pages frames in the range from 1024i to 1024(i+1)-1. (i is the page directory index.) The range of the last chunk which is index 1023 is from 1047552 to 1048575. The page frame is 1047552 and the page behind it is 1047553.

## 8. Write a program that loops many times, each time using an inner loop to access every 4096th element of a large array of bytes. Time how long your program takes per array access. Do this with varying array sizes. Are there any array sizes when the average time suddenly changes? Write a report in which you explain what you did, and the hardware and software system context in which you did it, carefully enough that someone could replicate your results.

### a. Code

~~~c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<time.h>

int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
	clock_t start_t, finish_t;
	int i, j, randomValue = 0, arraySize = 0;
	int *vmArray;

	arraySize = atoi(argv[1]);
	printf("Using array of %d elements.\n", arraySize);


	vmArray = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*arraySize);

	srand(17);

	for(i=0;i<arraySize;i++) vmArray[i] = (rand() % 100);
	
	start_t = clock();
	for(i=0;i<arraySize;i+=4096) printf("o");
	
	finish_t = clock();

	printf("\ntotal time : %f\n", (double)(finish_t-start_t));
	free(vmArray);

	return 0;
}

~~~

### b. Result

arraysize - time<br>
1 - 4.00<br>
10 - 4.00<br>
100 - 3.00<br>
1,000 - 3.00<br>
10,000 - 3.00<br>
100,000 - 4.00<br>
1,000,000 - 10.00<br>
10,000,000 - 67.00<br>
100,000,000 - 551.00<br>
<br>
<br>
The average time suddenly changes in 10,000,000 and 100,000,000 array size.
