==================================

Question 1 mutex reversing:          5/ 5 points

Question 2 auditing code change:     5/ 5 points

Question 3 test program:            15/20 points
   You have the tester but I don't see tests for the original code, only
      for the modified code which is for problem number 4.  Sorry, but
      that costs you some points.

Question 4 notifyall() addition:     8/10 points
   Your program doesn't test extensively to ensure that the threads both
      react properly when filling and emptying the buffer.  Sorry, but
      that also costs you some points.

Question 5a 2-phase locking:         5/ 5 points

Question 5b short read locks:        4/ 5 points
   No, it's not possible.  With read committed isolation, the writes will
      have exlusive locks, so T1 will have exclusive write access for the
      duration of the transaction.  Since write locks are exclusive, in
      this case it's the same outcome as with two-phase locking.

Question 5c snapshot isolation:      5/ 5 points

Question 6 virtual address xlate:    5/ 5 points

Question 7 calc. explanation:        5/ 5 points

Question 8 loop 4096 analysis:      20/20 points
   Good work on this one... clean code and good presentation of results.

Question 9 fork() tree:             15/15 points
   Nice drawing!

Total 92 out of 100 = 92.00% which is an A-minus
