CMSI 387 Operating Systems
   Semester Project
===================================

As I discussed with Kevin in class, this isn't quite what we have in mind
as a "Linux modification."  The idea is to either modify some command which
is within the kernel, write a new operating system command that you can
*integrate* into the kernel, or write/modify some utility which will then
be TIGHTLY COUPLED with the kernel.  A spreadsheet program is something
which is an application, not a utility or a kernel function.  It is also
too large of an application to get done in a single semester, even when
limited to "basic" functions and when done with three people.

Let's talk about something else and come up with a different idea.

Project respectfully and regrettably declined, pending further discussion.
