CMSI 387 Operating Systems
   Semester Project
===================================

I'll take this as both the preliminary and the detailed design document
for your project.

This submission is a little light on details for a detailed design, but
it will work for the preliminary design.  If you look at the project
description page at:

      http://bjohnson.lmu.build/cmsi387web/osproject.html

...it tells you what is expected.  When I asked for a "detailed list"
what is meant is a list of what modules you will be changing, and a
brief description of the changes you have planned for that module.

What you have meets the bare minimum of what is intended for your
*preliminary* design document, but you will need to add more to it by
the end of the semester.
